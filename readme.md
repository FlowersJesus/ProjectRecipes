This is my first project.

It will contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This is to help build my HTML chops, I hope to revisit this page and style it with CSS.

I will also explore using Git for the first time and writing coherent commit messages for future others. 

:)

quick change test

Currently applying CSS using my knowledge of the box model!
Going to be learning Flexbox CSS and hopefully applying Javascript/Advanced CSS to this page!
I've avoided rewriting everything and am just adding on to what was previously built.
